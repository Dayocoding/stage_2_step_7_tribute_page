<h3 id="headline">The Life Of Poly Styrene</h3>
  <section id=tribute-info>
    <p>3 July 1976, Hastings Pier. It’s my birthday and I’ll party if I want to.” Marianne Joan Elliott-Said is attending a Sex Pistols gig on her 19th birthday. “I stand centre point in an almost empty ballroom; three Swedish babes stared at Johnny.” Inspired by Rotten and co, the teenager decides to form her own band and places an ad in Melody Maker: “Young punx who want to stick it together,” she writes. She adopts a new moniker from the Yellow Pages – a send up of popstar attributes (plastic, disposable) – and shortly after, Poly Styrene and her band X-Ray Spex are playing their first gig at The Roxy in Covent Garden. A British punk legend was born.</p>

<ul> 
  <li><strong>Born Marianne Joan Elliot-Said on 3rd July 1957</strong> in Bromley, Kent. Raised in Brixton, London.</li>

  <li>When she was 15 she ran away from home with £3 in her pocket, and hitchhiked from one music festival to another, staying at hippie crash pads. Thinking of this as a challenge to survive, her adventure ended when she stepped on a rusty nail while bathing in a stream and had to be treated for sepsis.</li>

<li>Having been 'an itinerant traveller, alternative fashion designer and a reggae (ska) singer, she saw the Sex Pistols perform at the Pier Pavilion Hastings on her nineteenth birthday, 3 July 1976, and decided to form the punk band X-Ray Spex.</li>

<li>left X-ray spex in 1979, reformed for an album in 1995 and gig in 2008.</li> 

<li>She had a daughter, Celeste Bell-Dos Santos,and lived alone in St Leonards, East Sussex.</li>

<li>After the original line-up of X-Ray Spex broke up in 1979, Poly Styrene recorded a solo album, Translucence, in 1980. The album abandoned X-Ray Spex's loud guitar work for a quieter and more jazzy sound that has since been described as foreshadowing later work by Everything but the Girl. In 1986, she released the EP God's & Godesses [sic] on the Awesome record label. A New Age solo album, Flower Aeroplane, followed in 2004.</li>

<li>In February 2011, in an interview published in The Sunday Times magazine, which largely focused on her past and present relationship with her daughter Celeste, Styrene revealed that she had been treated for breast cancer, and that it had spread to her spine and lungs. She died of metastatic breast cancer on 25 April 2011, at the age of 53</li>
